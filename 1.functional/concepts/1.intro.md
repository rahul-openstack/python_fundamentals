# Zen of Python 

1. Beautiful is better than ugly 
2. Explicit id better than explicit 
3. Simple is better than complex
4. Complex is better than complicated
5. Flat is better than nested 
6. Sparse is better than nested 
7. Readability counts 
   1. For developers, reviewers, maintainers 
8. Special cases aren't special enough to break rules 
9. Practicality breaks purity; 
10. Errors should never pass silently
    1. Unless explicitly silenced
11. In the face of ambiguity, refuse temptation to guess
12. There should be preferably one Obvious way to do it; 
13. Obviously that way may not be obvious at first unless you are Dutch; 
14. Now is better than never 
15. Although never is better than right now; 
16. If the implementation is hard to explain, its a bad idea; 
17. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea;
18. Namespaces are honking great idea, lets do more of those;
